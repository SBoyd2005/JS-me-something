    <p>  I am a disciplined young man, defined through diverse personal and professional experience. I
        strive
        to constantly improve my mind, body, and soul each day. I have a Midwestern work ethic with a
        California heart and soul.
        In my spare time, I enjoy exercising, particulary running and weight lifting. I love to challenge
        myself and want to do a half-marathon and full marathon soon! In addition, I am a world-traveler
        and my favorite city in the United States to visit is San Francisco. I love watching sports and I
        am an avid fan of the Saint Louis Blues, Saint Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, and Green Bay
        Packers. I am very eclectic with my music taste and have seen Metallica, Paul McCartney, Garth
        Brooks, the Beach Boys, Journey, and Def Leppard in concert.</p>
